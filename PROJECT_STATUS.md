## üîß Known Issues

### Video Display (In Progress)
- [ ] **Framebuffer video still failing on test Pi**
  - Status: Investigating permission and driver issues
  - Workaround: Desktop mode works reliably
  - Next: Try MPV with DRM output as alternative

### Stream Database
- [ ] **Stream database needs periodic refresh**
  - Many URLs become stale over time
  - Need automated stream validation system
  - Consider multiple stream sources for redundancy

## üöÄ Roadmap / Future Improvements

### User Experience
- [ ] Simple web interface for remote monitoring
- [ ] Stream category selection (news, movies, etc.)
- [ ] Volume control via remote/web interface
- [ ] Channel change functionality

### Reliability
- [ ] Automated stream database updates
- [ ] Health monitoring with alerts
- [ ] Automatic recovery from system issues
- [ ] Bandwidth monitoring and quality adjustment

### Management
- [ ] Over-the-air updates without SSH
- [ ] Configuration management web interface
- [ ] Usage statistics and monitoring
- [ ] Multiple Pi management from single interface

## üìä Current Status

**Development Environment**: ‚úÖ Fully functional  
**Pi Deployment**: ‚úÖ Working with desktop mode  
**Video Output**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Desktop mode works, framebuffer needs investigation  
**Audio Output**: ‚úÖ HDMI audio working  
**Service Management**: ‚úÖ Auto-start and restart working  
**Stream Playbook**: ‚úÖ 3000+ tested streams available  
**Remote Management**: ‚úÖ SSH and git-based updates working  

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Resolve framebuffer video issue**
   - Test MPV with DRM output
   - Investigate Pi-specific video drivers
   - Document working configurations

2. **Stream database maintenance**
   - Validate current stream URLs
   - Add stream refresh automation
   - Implement backup stream sources

3. **Production deployment**
   - Test on target Pi hardware
   - Validate 24/7 operation
   - Setup remote monitoring

## üí° Lessons Learned

- **VLC vs MPV**: MPV often more reliable for headless video output
- **Framebuffer complexity**: Permission, driver, and console conflicts common
- **Virtual environments**: Essential for consistent Pi deployments
- **Git workflow**: Much more reliable than direct file copying
- **Comprehensive diagnostics**: Save significant debugging time
- **Desktop mode**: Most reliable fallback for video output issues
