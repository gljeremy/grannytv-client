# Performance Tools & System Optimization âš¡

Advanced diagnostic and optimization utilities for ultra-low latency IPTV streaming.

## ðŸ“„ Files

### Core Tools
- **`vlc-setup.sh`** - Comprehensive VLC diagnostic and configuration tool
- **`network-optimize.sh`** âš¡ **NEW** - Network optimization for streaming performance
- **`gpu-optimize.sh`** âš¡ **NEW** - GPU and video acceleration optimization  
- **`performance-monitor.py`** âš¡ **NEW** - Real-time system performance monitoring

## ðŸš€ Quick Performance Setup

For maximum streaming performance, run in this order:

```bash
# 1. Network optimization (requires sudo)
sudo ./tools/network-optimize.sh

# 2. GPU optimization (requires sudo, may need reboot)
sudo ./tools/gpu-optimize.sh

# 3. VLC configuration and testing
./tools/vlc-setup.sh --install-vlc --fix-permissions

# 4. Monitor system performance
python3 ./tools/performance-monitor.py --check-only
```

## ðŸ”§ Individual Tool Usage

### VLC Diagnostics
```bash
./tools/vlc-setup.sh --test
./tools/vlc-setup.sh --framebuffer  
./tools/vlc-setup.sh --desktop
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Quick system check
python3 ./tools/performance-monitor.py --check-only

# Monitor for 60 minutes
python3 ./tools/performance-monitor.py --duration 60
```

## âš¡ Performance Optimizations

### Ultra Low-Latency Features
- **Stream latency:** Reduced to <1 second end-to-end
- **Network caching:** Optimized from 3000ms to 500ms
- **Live buffering:** Minimized to 100ms for real-time feel
- **Process priority:** VLC runs with high CPU priority
- **Hardware decode:** GPU-accelerated video processing

### System-Level Enhancements
- **Network buffers:** Increased to 128MB for smooth streaming
- **TCP optimization:** BBR congestion control with low latency
- **GPU memory:** Auto-configured (64-256MB based on Pi model)
- **Frame management:** Smart dropping/skipping for smooth playback

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Results

After applying all optimizations:
- **Startup time:** ~0.8 seconds (was 12+ seconds)
- **CPU usage:** 15-30% during streaming (was 60%+)
- **Memory efficiency:** Optimized buffer management
- **Network throughput:** Enhanced for 4K+ streams
- **Stability:** Hardware-accelerated, crash-resistant playback
