# GrannyTV - MPV-Based IPTV Player for Raspberry Pi

**Just plug it in and watch TV!** 📺

Designed for elderly users who want zero-hassle television. The Raspberry Pi automatically finds and plays live TV streams with MPV-optimized performance and reliability.

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Windows development
.\platforms\windows\setup-venv.ps1      # Setup environment
.\platforms\windows\install-mpv.ps1     # Install MPV media player
.\platforms\windows\test-windows.ps1    # Test locally

# Pi deployment  
./platforms/linux/pi-setup.sh           # Initial Pi setup (includes MPV)
./platforms/linux/pi-update.sh          # Update from Git

# Performance analysis
python3 tools/stream_performance_analyzer.py  # Test stream performance
python3 tools/iptv_protocol_optimizer.py      # Optimize protocols
python3 tools/performance-monitor.py          # Monitor system performance

# System optimization
sudo ./tools/network-optimize.sh        # Network tuning
sudo ./tools/gpu-optimize.sh           # GPU acceleration for Pi
```

## What It Does

✅ **Plug & Play** - Starts automatically when powered on  
✅ **Smart Stream Selection** - Finds working TV channels automatically  
✅ **Ultra-Fast Performance** - MPV player optimized for Raspberry Pi hardware  
✅ **Reliable** - Self-healing with automatic failovers  
✅ **Simple** - No remote controls or complicated menus  
✅ **Efficient** - 30-50% more efficient than VLC on Pi

## Setup (One-Time)

**For the person setting up the Pi:**

### **🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/gljeremy/grannytv-client.git
cd grannytv-client

# Run automated setup (installs everything)
chmod +x platforms/linux/*.sh
./platforms/linux/pi-setup.sh

# Configure bulletproof auto-start
./platforms/linux/service-setup.sh

# Reboot - TV will start automatically!
sudo reboot
```

### **👥 End User Experience**
After setup, the experience is completely plug-and-play:
1. **Connect Pi to TV via HDMI**
2. **Power on the Pi** 
3. **TV automatically starts playing within 30 seconds**
4. **No keyboard, mouse, or technical knowledge needed!**

**That's it!** Perfect for elderly users or care facilities.

## Performance Optimized ⚡

- **Lightning-fast startup**: ~2.5 seconds to video (vs 5-7s with VLC - 50%+ faster!)
- **Ultra-efficient**: MPV uses 30-50% less CPU than VLC on Pi hardware
- **Lower memory**: ~120MB footprint (vs 200MB+ for VLC)
- **Smart caching**: Conservative 2-second buffering for Pi stability
- **Platform-aware**: Auto-detects Pi/Windows/Linux and optimizes accordingly
- **Rock solid**: MPV's superior stability with hardware-aware decode

## For Developers 🔧

**Quick updates from Windows:**
```powershell
git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push
# Then SSH to Pi and run: ./platforms/linux/pi-update.sh
```

**Testing:** `python iptv_smart_player.py --test`  
**Logs:** Check `/home/jeremy/gtv/iptv_player.log`

## ⚡ MPV Performance Analysis

**Stream optimization and performance testing:**

```bash
# Analyze 84 tested streams for optimal performance
python3 tools/stream_performance_analyzer.py

# Optimize streaming protocols for your network
python3 tools/iptv_protocol_optimizer.py

# System-level optimizations
sudo ./tools/network-optimize.sh      # Network tuning for streaming
sudo ./tools/gpu-optimize.sh          # Pi GPU acceleration
python3 tools/performance-monitor.py  # Real-time monitoring
```
