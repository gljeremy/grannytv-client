# Network Setup Fix - Version 2 (Revised)

## Problems Identified

After the first fix attempt failed, deeper analysis revealed:

### 1. **Network IP Stuck at 192.168.4.1**
   - **Root Cause**: The sed command syntax was wrong
   - Previous: `/# GrannyTV.../,/nohook wpa_supplicant/d` - deletes range from start to END pattern
   - Problem: If END pattern not found, nothing gets deleted or wrong content deleted
   - **Fix**: `/# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration/,+3d` - deletes comment line + exactly 3 lines after

### 2. **Network Manager Conflicts**
   - **Root Cause**: Both NetworkManager AND dhcpcd enabled simultaneously
   - Previous fix blindly enabled NetworkManager without checking if it exists/is active
   - This creates conflicts on systems using dhcpcd (traditional Raspberry Pi)
   - **Fix**: Detect which system is running, only enable one

### 3. **Playback Service Not Starting**
   - **Root Cause**: `iptv-player.service` used `graphical-session.target`
   - This target doesn't exist on headless/server systems
   - Service would never start even if network worked
   - **Fix**: Change to `multi-user.target` (standard on all Linux systems)

## Changes Made

### 1. **setup_server.py** (finalize endpoint)

**Before:**
```python
# Complex Python file parsing that couldn't handle permissions
with open('/etc/dhcpcd.conf', 'r') as f:
    dhcpcd_lines = f.readlines()
# ... 20+ lines of parsing logic ...
with open('/tmp/dhcpcd.conf.cleaned', 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(cleaned_lines)
subprocess.run(['sudo', 'cp', '/tmp/dhcpcd.conf.cleaned', '/etc/dhcpcd.conf'])
```

**After:**
```python
# Simple, reliable sed command
subprocess.run([
    'sudo', 'sed', '-i',
    '/# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration/,+3d',
    '/etc/dhcpcd.conf'
], check=True)
```

**Network Manager Detection:**
```python
# Check which network manager is active
nm_active = subprocess.run(['systemctl', 'is-active', 'NetworkManager'], 
                          capture_output=True, text=True).returncode == 0

if nm_active:
    # Use NetworkManager (modern Raspberry Pi OS)
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'systemctl', 'enable', 'NetworkManager'])
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'systemctl', 'stop', 'dhcpcd'])
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'systemctl', 'disable', 'dhcpcd'])
else:
    # Use dhcpcd (traditional Raspberry Pi)
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'systemctl', 'enable', 'wpa_supplicant'])
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'systemctl', 'enable', 'dhcpcd'])
```

### 2. **restore-normal-wifi.sh**

Added network manager detection:
```bash
if systemctl is-active --quiet NetworkManager; then
    echo "ðŸ”„ Using NetworkManager..."
    sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager 2>/dev/null || true
else
    echo "ðŸ”„ Using dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant..."
    sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

### 3. **iptv-player.service**

**Before:**
```ini
[Unit]
After=network-online.target graphical-session.target sound.target
Wants=network-online.target graphical-session.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

**After:**
```ini
[Unit]
After=network-online.target sound.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Changes:**
- Removed `graphical-session.target` dependency (doesn't exist on headless)
- Removed `Requires=network-online.target` (too strict, prevents startup)
- Changed install target to `multi-user.target` (universal Linux target)

### 4. **setup-wizard.sh** (embedded restore script)

Synchronized with standalone `restore-normal-wifi.sh`:
- Same sed command fix
- Same network manager detection logic
- Consistent behavior across all cleanup paths

## Technical Details

### The sed Command Explained

**What we're removing from dhcpcd.conf:**
```
# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration    <-- Line 1 (comment)
interface wlan0                           <-- Line 2 
static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24         <-- Line 3
nohook wpa_supplicant                     <-- Line 4
```

**Sed command:** `/# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration/,+3d`
- Find line with comment: `# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration`
- Delete that line AND the next 3 lines: `,+3d`
- Result: All 4 lines removed cleanly

**Why +3d instead of range to end pattern?**
- Range patterns can fail if end pattern doesn't match exactly
- Whitespace differences, line endings, or variations break it
- Fixed count is deterministic and reliable
- We know exactly what we added (4 lines), so we delete exactly 4 lines

### Network Manager Detection Logic

**Why check which is active?**
- Different Raspberry Pi OS versions use different network managers
- Older: dhcpcd + wpa_supplicant
- Newer: NetworkManager
- Running both causes IP conflicts and network instability

**Detection method:**
```bash
systemctl is-active --quiet NetworkManager
echo $?  # Returns 0 if active, non-zero if inactive
```

This is more reliable than checking if the package exists, because it tells us what's actually running.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### During Setup Finalization:
1. âœ… Hotspot services stopped (hostapd, dnsmasq)
2. âœ… Static IP flushed from wlan0
3. âœ… dhcpcd.conf cleaned (4 lines removed)
4. âœ… Correct network manager enabled (only one)
5. âœ… WiFi credentials applied to wpa_supplicant.conf
6. âœ… System reboots

### After Reboot:
1. âœ… dhcpcd.conf has NO hotspot configuration
2. âœ… Only one network manager is running (no conflicts)
3. âœ… wlan0 acquires DHCP IP from home router (e.g., 192.168.1.x)
4. âœ… iptv-player.service starts (multi-user.target exists)
5. âœ… Player connects to stream and begins playback
6. âœ… No manual intervention needed

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test dhcpcd.conf Cleanup
```bash
# Before cleanup - should show hotspot config
grep -A 3 "GrannyTV Setup Hotspot" /etc/dhcpcd.conf

# Run cleanup
sudo sed -i '/# GrannyTV Setup Hotspot Configuration/,+3d' /etc/dhcpcd.conf

# After cleanup - should show nothing
grep -A 3 "GrannyTV Setup Hotspot" /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

### 2. Test Network Manager Detection
```bash
# Check which is running
systemctl is-active NetworkManager && echo "NetworkManager" || echo "dhcpcd"

# Verify only one is enabled after cleanup
systemctl is-enabled NetworkManager
systemctl is-enabled dhcpcd
# Only ONE should return "enabled"
```

### 3. Test Service Startup
```bash
# Check if multi-user.target exists (should always return active)
systemctl is-active multi-user.target

# Test player service
sudo systemctl enable iptv-player
sudo systemctl start iptv-player
sudo systemctl status iptv-player
# Should show "active (running)"
```

### 4. Full Integration Test
```bash
# Run setup wizard
./setup/setup-wizard.sh

# Complete setup via smartphone
# - Connect to GrannyTV-Setup
# - Configure WiFi and settings
# - Click "Complete Setup"

# After reboot, check:
ip addr show wlan0 | grep "inet "
# Should show home network IP (e.g., 192.168.1.50)
# NOT 192.168.4.1

systemctl status iptv-player
# Should show "active (running)"

# Check logs
tail -f ~/gtv/iptv_service.log
# Should show successful stream connection
```

## Rollback Plan

If this fix doesn't work, restore from backup:

```bash
# Restore dhcpcd.conf
sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd.conf.backup /etc/dhcpcd.conf

# Reset to previous commit
cd ~/gtv
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Manually configure network
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "YourSSID" password "YourPassword"
# OR
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
# Add your network manually
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] dhcpcd.conf cleanup works (verified by grep showing no results)
- [ ] Correct network manager is running (only one enabled)
- [ ] IP address changes from 192.168.4.1 to home network range
- [ ] iptv-player.service starts automatically
- [ ] Playback works without manual intervention
- [ ] Full setup-to-playback flow works end-to-end
