# Documentation

Project documentation and guides.

## 📚 Contents

**Note:** Documentation files were previously in this folder but have been moved to the root directory for easier access. This folder structure is prepared for future documentation organization.

All documentation is currently in the root directory:

- **`README.md`** - Main project documentation
- Other documentation files as needed

## 📁 Future Structure

When documentation grows, it will be organized here as:

- **User Guides** - Setup and usage instructions
- **Developer Docs** - API references and development workflows  
- **Troubleshooting** - Problem-solving guides
- **Architecture** - System design and technical details
